II am a PhD candidate at the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of Michigan State
University, under the advisory of <a href='https://www.egr.msu.edu/people/profile/jpapapol'>Dr. John Papapolymerou</a>. My research focuses on antenna and RF devices design and implementation using
Additive Manufacture (AM) techniques for developing time and cost efficient prototyping methods. In my research I use
concepts from electromagnetic fields, radio frequency integrated circuits, material science and
additive manufacture techniques. 

  I received my Bachelor and Master in Engineering (M.Eng.) degrees from <a href='https://www.ntua.gr/en/from'>National Technical University of Athens</a>
in 2015 and Master of Science (MSc.) from <a href='https://msu.edu/'>Michigan State University</a> in 2020. Prior to joining Michigan State University, I was
working for Nokia Networks as a software engineer.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.
Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
